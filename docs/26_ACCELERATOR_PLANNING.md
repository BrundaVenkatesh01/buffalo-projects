# '26 Accelerator Planning

> *"15 weeks. Make progress. Find your people."*

## Overview

A 15-week open-source accelerator where the community helps build it. First 10 weeks focused on building, last 5 weeks on competition with pyramid-style elimination.

**Open source meaning:** The community helps design future cohorts, curriculum, and judging criteria.

---

## Core Outcome

**What participants walk away with:**
- Real progress on their project (Point A → Point B)
- People to build with (co-founders, collaborators, network)

---

## Who Can Join

Anyone building anything:
- Idea stage
- Side project
- Established business
- Skill you want to showcase
- Research you want to apply

**Only requirement:** You're working on something and want to make progress.

---

## Structure

### Phase 1: Build (Weeks 1-10)

#### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Week kickoff - theme/focus announced |
| Midweek | Workshop or AMA (community-sourced topics) |
| Friday | Check-in - share progress publicly |
| Weekend | Peer feedback round |

#### Milestones

- **Week 3:** Define your Point B (where you're headed)
- **Week 6:** Evidence check (show progress signals)
- **Week 10:** Final build submission

#### Cohort Structure

- **Pods** - 4-5 people, accountability group
- **Full cohort** - Everyone sees each other's updates
- **Mentors/Alumni** - Office hours, async feedback

---

### Phase 2: Compete (Weeks 11-15)

#### Pyramid Format

```
Week 11: 32 → 16  (Top 50%)
Week 12: 16 → 8   (Top 50%)
Week 13: 8 → 4    (Top 50%)
Week 14: 4 → 2    (Top 50%)
Week 15: 2 → 1    (Finals)
```

*Adjust numbers based on cohort size*

#### Each Round

1. Participants present - Progress demo
2. Community votes - X% of score
3. Judges score - Y% of score
4. Advancement announced

#### Judging Criteria

- Progress made (Point A → Point B delta)
- Evidence quality (not just claims)
- Community engagement (did they help others?)
- Presentation clarity

## Cool Possibilities

### Community Mechanics
- **Bounties** - Post challenges, others claim for points
- **Skill swaps** - Matchmaking: backend ↔ design
- **Public builds** - Everyone builds in public
- **Alumni mentors** - Winners mentor next cohort

### Competition Twists
- **Wildcard round** - Eliminated can be saved by community vote
- **Team formation mid-program** - Solo builders can merge
- **Audience favorite** - Separate track from judges' pick
- **Progress multiplier** - Starting further behind = bonus points

### Content & Learning
- **Community-sourced curriculum** - Vote on workshop topics
- **Failure shares** - Weekly "what didn't work" session
- **Expert AMAs** - Bring in founders, designers, engineers
- **Tool drops** - Partner with tools for free credits

### Incentives & Rewards
- **Points economy** - Earn points for helping others
- **Tiered completion** - Bronze/Silver/Gold
- **Employer showcase** - Companies can scout participants

### Platform Integration
- **Live progress feed** - Canvas updates visible in real-time
- **Time capsule** - Locked snapshot of start, revealed at end
- **Give/Ask matching** - Auto-match complementary needs

### Post-Program
- **Alumni directory** - Searchable by skills, location
- **Demo day recording** - Permanent showcase
- **"Where are they now"** - 6-month follow-up stories

### Wild Ideas
- **IRL finale** - Final 4 present in person
- **Build streaks** - Ship every week, visible counter
- **Anti-pitch** - Finals must be demos only, no slides
