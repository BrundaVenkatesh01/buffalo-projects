# Playwright MCP Server Configuration for Claude Desktop
# This file should be placed in your home directory as @config.toml
# Or in Claude Desktop's config directory depending on your setup

# Option 1: Use the official @playwright/mcp package (recommended)
# This works out of the box and requires no additional setup
[mcp_servers.playwright]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
# Optional: Set working directory to your project root
# env = { "PWD" = "/Users/laneyfraass/Buffalo-Projects" }

# Option 2: Use the custom local server (for project-specific tools)
# Uncomment below and comment out Option 1 to use the custom server
# [mcp_servers.playwright-custom]
# command = "node"
# args = ["/Users/laneyfraass/Buffalo-Projects/tools/playwright-mcp/server.mjs"]
# env = { "PWD" = "/Users/laneyfraass/Buffalo-Projects" }
