# Buffalo Projects Mission

## Our Why

**Differentiation should be celebrated, not gatekept.**

Anyone building something—a startup, indie product, research project, design system, YouTube channel, open-source tool—shouldn't need permission or a "track record" to showcase their work and get meaningful feedback.

Buffalo Projects is a **community-owned gallery and validation platform** where builders document their journey transparently and peers provide honest feedback.

---

## What We Believe

### 1. **Private by Default, Public by Choice**

Building something new is scary. You need a safe space to iterate before the world sees it. Once you're ready, the gallery is always there.

Your workspace is **only visible to you** unless you explicitly publish. No surprise lurking, no algorithm deciding when you're "ready."

### 2. **Peer Validation > Gatekeepers**

You don't need a VC, teacher, or "expert" to validate your idea. You need **people actually using and caring about what you build**.

Comments from fellow builders—makers who are building themselves—often matter more than formal mentorship.

### 3. **Open Commons, Not Closed Garden**

Buffalo doesn't own your data. You do. You can:

- Export everything anytime
- Delete permanently
- Run your own instance if you want
- Leave without losing your work

This is a **community asset**, not a startup trying to extract value.

### 4. **Diverse Builds, One Platform**

Not everyone is a founder pitching to VCs. We celebrate:

- **Startups** validating product-market fit
- **Indie makers** shipping side projects and businesses
- **Designers** building design systems or personal brands
- **Researchers** testing hypotheses publicly
- **Creators** documenting their creative journey
- **Open-source maintainers** showcasing their impact
- **Artists** building a portfolio and audience
- **Students** displaying capstone projects or research

One project doesn't look like another, and that's the point.

### 5. **Transparency Over Opacity**

How do decisions get made? How is data handled? Who has power? We tell you.

- Roadmap changes are discussed openly
- Data handling is documented (see [PRIVACY_CHARTER.md](./PRIVACY_CHARTER.md))
- Community input shapes priorities (see [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md))
- Nothing is hidden behind "we'll figure it out"

## What Success Looks Like

**In 6 Months:**

- 500+ creators building on Buffalo
- 200+ projects published to gallery
- Real feedback loops: people improving their work because of comments
- Zero high-severity trust/privacy issues
- Community contributing ideas, not just consuming

**In 2 Years:**

- 5,000+ active builders
- Gallery becomes a reference for "what's being built" in the community
- Self-hosted instances running (universities, accelerators, regions)
- Sustainable funding model (donations, not extraction)
- Mentorship connections happening organically (not enforced)

**Long-term (5+ Years):**

- Buffalo is the platform builders use when they want peer validation over VC validation
- Community-driven feature development (not top-down roadmap)
- Multiple decentralized instances sharing data
- Sustainable commons: no exit, no pivot, just building

## What We Won't Do

❌ **Sell your data** - Ever. To anyone. Full stop.

❌ **Gamify fake metrics** - No "virality" scores, engagement algorithms, or vanity counters.

❌ **Force gatekeeping** - No "invite-only" status or founder-only clubs.

❌ **Monetize creators** - No "growth plans" that take a cut of your revenue or gate features.

❌ **Lock you in** - Your projects are always exportable. Always deletable.

❌ **Abandon the community** - If we ever need to shut down, code goes open-source and data goes to you.

## The Community Comes First

This isn't a company trying to build a community. **It's a community building a platform.**

That means:

- Your feedback shapes the roadmap, not growth metrics
- Sustainability matters more than scale
- Trust is earned every day
- If the platform stops serving builders, it fails—even if it's "successful" by VC metrics

## How to Help

You don't need to be a developer.

- **Builder?** Use Buffalo, share your work, give honest feedback
- **Designer?** Improve the UX and share ideas
- **Writer?** Help us document and communicate better
- **Mentor?** Leave thoughtful comments on projects you care about
- **Organizer?** Help seed the community with projects and people
- **Developer?** Contribute code, file bugs, audit security
- **Skeptic?** Push back—we need people questioning assumptions

## Questions?

**Is Buffalo asking for money?**
Not now. Long-term, we'll likely need funding (hosting costs, moderation, etc.). The model: donations + community sponsorship, not VC. Never extraction.

**Can I self-host?**
Yes. Code is open. We'll provide a self-hosted guide post-launch.

**What if you shut down?**
Code is open-source. Data exports are always available. Community has a migration path.

**How do I know you're serious about this?**
Read [PRIVACY_CHARTER.md](./PRIVACY_CHARTER.md) and [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md). We've built in the constraints that force us to keep our promises.

**What if the community wants something we disagree with?**
We listen. If it's aligned with our mission (peer validation, transparency, openness), we build it. If it contradicts our core values, we explain why and find middle ground.
