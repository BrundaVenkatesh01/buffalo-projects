# Buffalo Projects Governance

## The Principle

**Decisions affecting the community should include the community.**

Buffalo isn't run by a benevolent dictator or a secret board. It's run by the people building on it.

---

## How Decisions Get Made

### Tier 1: Operational Decisions (Core Team)

**Who:** Core maintainers (2-3 people currently)  
**What:** Day-to-day operations that don't affect user promises

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Hotfixes for security issues
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Moderation of abuse (spam, DMCA)

**Transparency:** Discussed in public GitHub issues; summary posted monthly

### Tier 2: Feature Decisions (Community Input)

**Who:** Core team + community consensus  
**What:** Changes to platform features, new tools, roadmap priorities

- New workspace features
- Gallery filtering or discovery changes
- Community features (feedback, comments, etc.)
- Privacy or security enhancements

**Process:**

1. **Proposal** - Posted in GitHub discussions with use cases and trade-offs
2. **Feedback** - 2-week window for community questions and concerns
3. **Iteration** - Core team updates proposal based on feedback
4. **Decision** - If consensus, implement; if contentious, vote
5. **Implementation** - Public progress tracking in project board
6. **Retrospective** - Post-launch review (what worked, what didn't)

**Voting** (if consensus isn't clear):

- Community members get one vote each
- Votes posted in GitHub (logged with account, not anonymous)
- > 50% approval + >20 votes needed to pass
- Ties are escalated to advisory board

### Tier 3: Mission-Critical Decisions (Advisory Board + Full Vote)

**Who:** Advisory board + all-community vote  
**What:** Changes to core mission, data handling, monetization, or governance

- Adding monetization or paid features
- Changing privacy charter
- Fundamentally changing what Buffalo is
- Governance structure changes
- Acquisition or major partnership offers

**Process:**

1. **Proposal & Rationale** - Why this change? What are the risks?
2. **Community Discussion** - 4-week window for debate
3. **Advisory Board Review** - External advisors weigh in
4. **All-Community Vote** - Every member votes (one per account)
5. **Public Commitment** - If passed, we document exactly what changes and when

**Voting Threshold:**

- > 66% approval required
- > 50% of active members must vote
- No vote can be split between "yes" and "abstain"—abstentions don't count

## The Roadmap

### How Features Get Prioritized

**Monthly prioritization process:**

1. **Community Feedback** - Review feature requests, GitHub issues, in-app feedback
2. **Core Team Assessment** - Technical feasibility, impact, maintenance burden
3. **Public Proposal** - What we're planning to work on and why
4. **Adjustment** - Community input shapes final list
5. **Execution** - Work in progress; updates posted weekly
6. **Review** - Did it solve the problem? Lessons for next month?

### Deferring Features

Some features are explicitly deferred. Why?

- **Complexity vs. Impact** - Not enough benefit to justify build cost
- **Waiting for Community** - Need more demand before committing
- **Conflict with Mission** - Contradicts privacy or openness values
- **Sustainability** - Maintenance burden too high long-term

**Deferred doesn't mean "no."** It means "not now, and here's why." We revisit quarterly.

---

## Conflict Resolution

### 1. Discussion

When disagreement arises:

- Post in GitHub (public record)
- Explain your position clearly
- Ask questions, don't assume
- 1-week discussion period

### 2. Mediation

If discussion doesn't resolve it:

- Advisory board steps in (neutral parties)
- They help clarify positions and find common ground
- Goal: agreement, not a winner

### 3. Vote

If mediation fails:

- Clear the proposal and hold a vote
- Community decides
- Decision is final for 6 months (can revisit if new info)

### 4. Escalation

If core team and community are in serious conflict:

- Independent mediator brought in
- Both sides present cases
- Mediator recommends decision
- Final vote if needed

---

## Amendments to Governance

**Governance can change.** Here's how:

1. **Proposal** - Anyone can propose governance changes
2. **Discussion** - 4-week debate period
3. **Advisory Board Input** - Do they think this is healthy?
4. **All-Community Vote** - >75% approval required
5. **Transition** - New rules take effect 30 days after vote

**Governance changes are rare.** We change the charter only when it stops serving the community.

---

## Transparency Practices

### Monthly Reports

**Published 1st of every month:**

- What decisions were made last month
- Who voted on what
- Budget/sustainability updates
- Metrics (users, projects, engagement)
- Community concerns and how we addressed them

### Quarterly Town Halls

**Published agenda 1 week in advance:**

- State of the platform
- Upcoming decisions
- Live Q&A with core team + advisory board
- Recording + transcript published afterward

### Annual Review

**Every January:**

- Full audit of decisions made that year
- What worked, what didn't
- Community feedback on governance itself
- Plan for improvements

### Real-Time Public Board

**GitHub Project Board:**

- Every feature request visible
- Status updates (backlog → in progress → done)
- Priority reasoning posted
- Community can comment and vote on prioritization

---

## When Things Go Wrong

### Bug or Security Issue

- Report privately to security@buffaloproject.io
- We investigate within 48 hours
- Fix timeline depends on severity (critical = 24hr, high = 1 week, normal = 1 month)
- Public disclosure after fix (or 90 days, whichever comes first)

### Governance Violation

If core team makes a decision without community input:

1. Community calls it out (GitHub issue)
2. Core team explains their reasoning
3. If unjustified, community vote to reverse or discipline
4. Transparent write-up of what happened and how we fix it

### Ethical Concern

- Report to ethics@buffaloproject.io
- Goes to advisory board (not core team)
- Independent investigation
- Public report of findings

---

## The Escape Hatch

**If you disagree with a major decision:**

- You can export all your data within 7 days
- No penalties or locks
- Move to another platform with everything intact
- We help with migration if needed

This isn't a threat; it's a check on our power. If we make bad decisions, you don't need permission to leave.

---

## Current Advisory Board

_(To be populated pre-launch)_

- TBD (Founder perspective)
- TBD (Designer perspective)
- TBD (Community organizer)
- TBD (Independent auditor)

**Nominations open to community.** Process: Nominate via GitHub, community votes.

---

## The Bottom Line

**We don't believe in benevolent dictators.** We believe in transparent processes that include the people building on Buffalo.

This isn't perfect. We'll mess up. But we'll do it in public and fix it with the community.

- Governance issues? → governance@buffaloproject.io
- Process concerns? → Post in GitHub discussions

Buffalo Projects: **Built with, not for, the community.**
